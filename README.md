## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://jdegand.github.io/odin-project-binary-search-trees

# Change into the directory
$ cd odin-project-binary-search-trees

# Run the script
$ node bst
```

## Thoughts

- Started by making tree root always null - changed much later to having a random array turned into a balanced bst set as root
- Had to compare and contrast code with other people's code a lot
- Watched various leet code demonstrations of binary search tree problems as well 
- Binary search trees are harder to conceptualize mentally without pen and paper - never quite sure it is working correctly
- While working on this, odin project directions were updated with a prettyPrint function that really helped visualize what is going on
